This project serves as the front-end component of a Fitness Trainer Application, offering seamless appointment management for fitness trainers. The application empowers trainers to efficiently handle their appointments, enabling them to perform tasks such as adding new clients, creating appointments for existing clients, editing appointment details, and deleting appointments. Clients without any associated appointments are automatically removed.

The application features a "Show Calendar" button, which, upon clicking, reveals a calendar view showcasing the trainer's appointments. To return to the original table view, the user can click the "Back to Clients" button.

User-friendly functionalities include the ability to edit client information by clicking on respective fields (First Name, Last Name, Location) and updating them upon clicking elsewhere. For appointment management, dedicated buttons for editing and deleting appointments are provided, facilitating a streamlined experience for fitness trainers.
